How to set up the lazydev Vite template

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If you're not sure, check with:
```
npm --version
```
If that prints a version number, npm is installed. If not, install Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org/ or use your package manager.

2. Make the start script executable.
```
chmod +x create.sh
```

3. Create a new Vite project by running the script provided:
```
./create.sh
```

4. Follow the interactive prompts to choose a framework and variant, then install dependencies and start the dev server. Example (after creating the project):
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. Have fun building your Vite app!
